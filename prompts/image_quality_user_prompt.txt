Your task is to evaluate the quality of the image based on the following criteria:

0 - Poorest quality:
- Extremely blurry or out of focus
- Severe overexposure or underexposure
- Heavy noise or grain
- Poor composition or framing
- Low resolution or heavily pixelated
- Severe color issues or distortions
- Impossible to evaluate the quality of the image based on the provided criteria
- Visible and distracting artifacts or distortions
- Significant color shift or incorrect white balance

1 - Average quality:
- Somewhat sharp, but not perfectly focused
- Slightly over or underexposed
- Noticeable but not excessive noise or grain
- Decent composition, but room for improvement
- Adequate resolution for general viewing
- Acceptable color reproduction
- Visible but not distracting artifacts or distortions
- Minor color issues or white balance problems

2 - Highest quality (tack-sharp, perfect image):
- Perfectly focused and sharp throughout
- Ideal exposure with excellent dynamic range
- Minimal to no visible noise or grain
- Excellent composition and framing
- High resolution with crisp details
- Accurate and vibrant color reproduction
- Proper use of depth of field
- Well-balanced lighting
- No visible artifacts or distortions
- Correct color balance and white point

If you cannot evaluate the quality of the image (e.g., too light or too dark) the image score should be 0 (zero).

Assess the quality of each image in the directory and provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:

{
  "score": X,
  "explanation": "Your detailed explanation here."
}

Where X is the score (0, 1, or 2), and the explanation provides a detailed justification for the score based on the criteria above.

VERY IMPORTANT: Provide only the JSON object in your response!
